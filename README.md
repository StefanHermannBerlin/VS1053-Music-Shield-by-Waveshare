# VS1053-Music-Shield-by-Waveshare
This file is a updated demo code from Adafruit what was designed to run their VS1053 products. The Music Shield by Waveshare isn't working with it from scratch so I updated basically pins and deleted some not supported things (like Interrupts).

It is not meant to be a perfect library adoption but it workes to play a track on command.
